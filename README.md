# React Weather App
A web application which allows users to search for locations globally and displays the current weather. The background changes depending on the weather conditions.
## Lessons Learned
This is my first project working with an external API. I learnt a lot about asynchronous Javascript and how to work with the JSON data returned including destructuring and displaying the required information for the user.
## Future Ideas
I would like to allow users to convert the temperature between Celsius & Fahrenheit.
I also would like to add an error message if the user makes an unsuccessful search.
